## üöÄ Installation and Usage

> This guide covers **Environment Setup**, **Extension Installation**, and **Packaging Instructions**.

### üîπ Step 1: Set Up Your Environment (One-Time Only)

This core step resolves the `No suitable shell found` error on Windows.

```powershell
# 1. Install Git for Windows (includes Git Bash, which is required)
# Download here: https://git-scm.com/

# 2. Install Node.js (LTS version recommended, ‚â• 18)
# Download here: https://nodejs.org/

# 3. Open PowerShell or CMD as an [Administrator] and run the following commands to set environment variables
#    (This tells npm to ignore scripts and sets Git Bash as the shell, fixing the core issue)
setx NPM_CONFIG_IGNORE_SCRIPTS true
setx SHELL "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
#    Note: If you installed Git in a different directory, update the path accordingly.

# 4. [IMPORTANT] Completely close and restart your PowerShell/CMD window for the changes to take effect.
```

### üîπ Step 2: Install and Verify Claude Code CLI

```powershell
# 1. In a [new] terminal window, globally install the Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Ensure the npm global directory is in your system's Path environment variable
#    The default path is usually: C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm
#    If you're unsure, add it manually to your system's "Path" variable.

# 3. Log in to Claude Code for the first time
claude login
#    A browser window will open for authorization ‚Üí Log in and copy the token ‚Üí Paste it back into the terminal.

# 4. Quickly verify the installation
claude chat -m sonnet -p "hello"
#    If you see a reply from Claude, your environment is ready!
```

### üîπ Step 3: Install This Extension

We offer two ways to install: **Build from Source** or **Install from VSIX**.

#### Method 1: Run from Source (for Developers)

```powershell
# Clone the project locally
git clone https://github.com/LKbaba/Claude-code-ChatInWindows.git
cd Claude-code-ChatInWindows
npm install  # Install dependencies

# Press F5 in VS Code or Cursor to run in debug mode
# Or run the following command for live-reloading
npm run watch
```

#### Method 2: Package as VSIX and Install (for Stable Use)

If you want to use the extension without running a debugger, you can package it into a `.vsix` file.

```powershell
# 1. Make sure you are in the project root and have run npm install

# 2. Compile and package the extension
npm run package

#    This command first runs `npm run compile` to build the TypeScript code,
#    then uses `vsce` to package it into a .vsix file, e.g., claude-code-chatui-1.3.0.vsix
```

**How to install a `.vsix` file:**

1. Open VS Code or Cursor.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
3. Type `Install from VSIX` and select **"Extensions: Install from VSIX..."**.
4. Locate and select the generated `.vsix` file to install the extension.

#### Method 3: Install from Marketplace (Recommended)

In the future, you will be able to search for **"Claude-code-ChatInWindows"** directly in the VS Code / Cursor Marketplace for a one-click install.

### üéâ Getting Started

* **Open Chat Panel**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+C`
* **Customize Settings**: Go to VS Code/Cursor Settings ‚Üí Search for `claudeCodeChatUI`

  // Path to Git Bash (usually auto-detected, no changes needed)
  "claudeCodeChatUI.windows.gitBashPath": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
