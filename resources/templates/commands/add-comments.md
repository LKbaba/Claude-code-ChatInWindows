# /add-comments

Add appropriate comments to the code:

1. **Function/Method Documentation**: JSDoc/TSDoc style
2. **Complex Logic**: Explain non-obvious code
3. **TODO/FIXME**: Mark areas needing attention
4. **Type Annotations**: Where helpful

Comment Types:
- File headers (purpose, author, date)
- Function documentation (params, returns, examples)
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Section dividers for organization

Guidelines:
- Explain "why", not "what"
- Keep comments concise
- Update comments when code changes
- Don't state the obvious

Provide the code with added comments, maintaining the original functionality.
