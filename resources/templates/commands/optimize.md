# /optimize

Analyze and optimize the code for performance:

1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Find performance issues
2. **Analyze Complexity**: Time and space complexity
3. **Suggest Optimizations**: Concrete improvements
4. **Implement**: Provide optimized code

Areas to Check:
- Algorithm efficiency (O(n) analysis)
- Unnecessary iterations
- Memory usage
- Caching opportunities
- Lazy loading potential
- Database query optimization
- Bundle size (for frontend)

Provide:
- Performance analysis
- Optimized code
- Expected improvement
- Trade-offs (if any)
